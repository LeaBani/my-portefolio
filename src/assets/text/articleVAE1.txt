Building a Resilient Supply Chain: Strategic Insights and Lessons from Crisis Management

In 2020, the global COVID-19 pandemic forced the world to rethink daily habits and drove industries to reevaluate and digitize key processes. Border closures and labor restrictions triggered transportation challenges and slowed the production of raw materials, leading to prolonged supply chain disruptions. This unprecedented crisis highlighted the importance of effective crisis management in Supply Chain operations and underscored the need for adaptable, resilient strategies. As industries pivoted to new digital tools and collaborative frameworks, they gained valuable insights into managing supply chain volatilityâ€”insights that remain crucial as new disruptions continue to reshape global markets.

To achieve excellence in Supply Chain management, five key principles outlined in The New Supply Chain Agenda align closely with strategies for managing canned goods during the COVID-19 crisis in my professional practice (Slone, Dittmann, & Mentzer, 2010, pp. 40-55):

1. Select the right leaders and cultivate talent within the Supply Chain.
2. Stay attuned to trends and emerging technologies in the Supply Chain.
3. Address and eliminate dysfunctions and gaps that hinder collaboration and communication within an organization.
4. Collaborate closely with suppliers and customers.
5 Implement a disciplined process for project and change management.
6. In managing complex supply chains, I introduced strategies for consolidating and redistributing canned goods and pooling stock resources to address delivery challenges. As a manager, I supported my team and various internal and external stakeholders in navigating the evolving landscape of the Supply Chain.

Through the measures implemented during this crisis, the company rose to the major challenge of transforming its Supply Chain, aligning ethical, environmental, and innovative practices and relationship transparency with economic objectives.

Supply Chain management highlights real challenges across human, technological, technical, and strategic dimensions. Beyond ensuring goods are available at the right time and place, it is crucial to adapt to current environmental and geopolitical contexts.

In 2022, the crisis between Russia and Ukraine once again disrupted supply chains. By then, our team was prepared, knowing how to respond. The model built during COVID-19 was replicated, and our experience was adjusted accordingly.

Since October 2023, the conflict in the Middle East has disrupted maritime supply routes in the Red Sea, one of the most significant disruptions since COVID-19 (Resilinc Editorial Team, 2024). New delivery routes must now be considered, and delivery timelines are extended.

This underscores why a Supply Chain must be scalable to adapt and maintain its efficiency.
