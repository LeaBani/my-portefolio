Research Project – Demand Planning & Artificial Intelligence in ERP Systems for Food Retail: Case Study on Public Holidays
1. Introduction
Planning around public holidays is a critical issue for large-scale food retail companies. Business closures and supply chain partners' interruptions during these periods cause significant variations in availability among different actors. Workloads and customer demand tend to shift to the days preceding or following public holidays, disrupting the finely orchestrated supply chain management cycle.
Each year, holidays may fall on different days or dates, necessitating an annual adjustment of planning strategies for the food retail sector. Accurate demand planning is essential for effective service quality. Sales and demand forecasting are critical steps to prevent merchandise waste and food spoilage. Overestimated demand forecasts immediately impact economic indicators and the company’s environmental footprint, while underestimated forecasts lead to stockouts, resulting in lost revenue and dissatisfaction among business clients and end consumers (Groene & Zakharov, 2024).
Demand fluctuations are a challenge for the industry. How can demand variation be anticipated in an era where information flows almost instantaneously via the internet, social media, and mobile apps? Consumption shifts in food retail are influenced by a multitude of criteria, which can be effectively represented through powerful mathematical models.
Recent experiences highlight efforts to develop agile supply chains. The disruptions and uncertain contexts that industries have faced in recent years, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, fuel shortages, and geopolitical conflicts, combined with advanced technological growth, have prompted researchers and companies to rethink supply chain strategy. By enhancing supply chain resilience, companies demonstrate reliability and improve competitiveness (Tukamuhabwa, Stevenson, Busby, & Zorzini, 2015). Businesses face complex scenarios where customer demand is difficult to predict. Theoretical research on supply chain resilience, supported by empirical studies, model testing, and advanced mathematical frameworks, strengthens professional practice during unpredictable events (Ghafour & Aljanabi, 2023).
The integration of new information and communication technologies has significantly impacted both industry and daily life (Wang, Zhou, Liu, Huang, & Yang, 2023). Globalization has intensified competition across sectors, positioning the supply chain as a key player in organizational competitiveness (Dubey et al., 2019). Cutting-edge technology is now essential for maintaining a competitive edge.
On November 30, 2022, OpenAI launched ChatGPT, bringing artificial intelligence (AI) to the public. AI in industry is introduced across multiple subfields: robotics for process automation, voice recognition, machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. These tools expand the possibilities for managing complex decisions and operations (Pessot, Zangiacomi, Marchiori, & Fornasiero, 2023). Early research on neural networks, a foundation of deep learning, dates back to McCulloch and Pitts' work in 1943. In 2024, it is the power of current machines that allows for the widespread use of these technologies.
To manage business operations, ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems are essential for supply chain management, especially in inventory management, order processing, and partner relations. ERP systems increase operational efficiency and facilitate documentation. Recent AI integrations into ERP systems have enabled companies to analyze data, enhancing agility and responsiveness to clients. This adaptability promotes a competitive and change-responsive image (Bawa, 2023). AI also helps streamline recurring administrative tasks, allowing partners to focus on building interpersonal relationships (Kehailou & Amansou, 2022).
The topic of operations management specifically for public holidays is rarely addressed in the food retail literature. This research project will explore similar concepts in other domains to develop a viable approach. The project aims to contribute to theoretical reflections on a highly sensitive subject within the professional landscape.
These themes lead us to formulate the central research question:
How can the integration of Artificial Intelligence in ERP systems strengthen supply chain resilience, particularly in demand planning during public holidays?
Initially, a literature review will examine themes related to the research topic. Next, an exploratory data collection among industry professionals will highlight opportunities, constraints, and necessary advancements for automation in business practice. The empirical analysis will provide responses to questions surrounding the research topic. Finally, a synthesis of the analyzed elements will identify unexplored research paths.
2. Literature Review
This study combines two key concepts. The first research area focuses on integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems for demand planning. The second area centers on demand planning specifically during holidays. We aim to provide insights into demand forecasting methods within operational planning for holidays, incorporating recent advancements in AI technology.
2.1 Demand Planning and AI Implementation
2.1.1 The Potential of AI in Data Management and Supply Chain Risk Management
AI enables managing a larger dataset than traditional statistical analysis, including historical data, promotional sales, and other contextual data (Forger, 2023). With the rise of Big Data, consumer behaviors can be incorporated into demand forecasts. In terms of supply chain risk management, AI can generate numerous scenarios based on models that integrate potential disruptions. AI can analyze all inputs following directives from company leaders (Richey, Chowdhury, Davis-Sramek, Giannakis, & Dwivedi, 2023).
A study by Irfan et al. (2022) combines AI, Business Intelligence (data visualization), and neural networks to categorize prediction methods for food sales in retail. Several models are compared, with the TOR AI model emerging as the most accurate (measured by Mean Squared Error, or MSE, indicating accuracy) and least variant. In the future, the combination of AI and advanced analytics may create a personalized purchasing system for each consumer. With AI’s increasing power, low-skill jobs may become obsolete as AI can complete tasks more quickly and accurately (Irfan, et al., 2022).
The quality and quantity of available time-series data remain prerequisites for accessible, applicable models in Supply Chain (Raiyani, Lathigara, & Mehta, 2021).
To reduce food waste on perishable goods, Birkmaier et al. (2023) provide a conceptual AI-based framework to balance supply and demand for perishables. This project integrates advanced planning methods, including weather information and mobile transaction data alongside internal company data. "Human intervention remains necessary due to contexts previously unstatistical, like holidays, promotions, stock, weather, and strikes" (Birkmaier, Imeri, Riester, & Reiner, 2023). The APPETITE platform makes analyzed data accessible to users via a dashboard, allowing suppliers to act on their inventory. Charitable organizations engaged in food redistribution can anticipate product types and pick-up locations based on this information.
AI improves data collection, visualization, and analysis for decision-making.
2.1.2 AI Integration in ERP
The concept of "strong" (or general) AI refers to machines capable of complex learning and tasks, like humans. Narrow (or weak, specialized) AI, however, is more commonly used in business for single, specific tasks like sales forecasting (Kunduru, 2023).
2.1.2.1 Opportunities
In 1992, Lopes first referred to ERP as a “better, faster, and more cost-effective” solution (Metaxiotis, Psarras, & Ergazakis, 2003). ERP software is widely used across industries, offering critical support and innovations like demand forecasting. For businesses seeking to integrate their processes, automate flows, and maintain real-time customer and supplier contact, ERP ensures competitive market positioning. AI’s integration into ERP systems is part of companies’ digital transformation, enabling customer behavior analysis, demand forecasting, supply chain optimization, and task automation (Bawa, 2023).
ERP-AI integration is essential for companies wishing to streamline economic processes, automate workflows, and maintain real-time supplier communication (Costin, 2020). Real-time data exchange enhances company responsiveness (Irfan, et al., 2022).
2.1.2.2 Risks
Data security and privacy are threatened by AI’s vast amount of sensitive data within ERP systems. Thus, robust cybersecurity measures are a priority in such projects (Bawa, 2023; Helo & Hao, 2022). Cyber resilience is critical to ensure data security, as malicious actors may infiltrate systems to steal information. A strong cybersecurity awareness culture is necessary within companies (Richey, Chowdhury, Davis-Sramek, Giannakis, & Dwivedi, 2023). Additionally, trust and risk perception towards service providers are crucial for companies; transparency in data management reinforces customer trust (Subramanian & Abdulrahman, 2017).
The costs associated with AI and ERP integration, including skilled personnel, training, software, and IT infrastructure, can be significant (Bawa, 2023). Implementing these complex Information Systems requires AI and ERP expertise.
Another concern in adopting automation and learning methods is user acceptance, as new skills in algorithmic work are required from supply chain professionals. Data Science teams support suppliers to overcome technical barriers (Fildes, Ma, & Kolassa, 2022; Bawa, 2023). However, this approach may not guarantee the acceptance of automated forecasting models, sometimes leading to complete rejection, as seen in a German bakery case (Fries & Ludwig, 2022). AI is perceived as a “black box,” and users may distrust forecasts due to unfamiliarity with the underlying processes (Forger, 2023; Fries & Ludwig, 2022; Bawa, 2023). Building trust in AI is essential for integrating AI into supply chain operations.
2.2 The Case of Holidays in Literature
2.2.1 Impact of Holidays on Operations
Consumer food consumption patterns shift during holidays. "Managing seasons and holidays is an endless task for retailers" (Ylinen, 2016). Retailers face demand variations, requiring manual adjustments to forecasts, which adds complexity as holiday data isn’t automatically integrated into companies’ systems. Consequently, urgent orders often disrupt normal warehouse and supplier workloads (Obermair, Holzapfel, & Kuhn, 2023). A UK beverage retailer’s case study confirms the benefits of adapting forecasts short-term based on weather, though short-term adjustments can destabilize supply chains (Nikolopoulos & Fildes, 2013). Advanced planning and communication with SC partners help mitigate surprises, though time-consuming.
Holiday impacts on sales are significant, drawing interest from the community. A survey of the top 30 German retailers revealed that 57% were interested in holiday planning (Obermair et al., 2023).
2.2.2 Holiday Categorization
In research, holidays impacting demand planning in retail are seldom explored, but a basic categorization exists (Ziel, 2018; Obermair et al., 2023):
•	Fixed-date holidays: These holidays have the same calendar date each year, like New Year’s Day or Christmas.
•	Fixed-day holidays: These holidays vary by year but occur around the same time annually, such as Easter in Europe or Eid al-Fitr in Muslim-majority countries.
2.2.3 A Global Perspective
The global impact of holidays garners attention from the retail sector annually due to the economic implications. In 2021, a post-COVID committee hosted a roundtable to discuss holiday best practices with ten American retailers (Redman, 2021). Retailers adapt their schedules during public holidays, which concentrates sales on limited days (Obermair, Holzapfel, & Kuhn, 2023).
Holiday effects extend beyond demand planning to overall operations, as the unpredictable holiday patterns complicate logistics annually, demanding greater SC partner collaboration.
2.2.4 Models in Research
No robust demand planning model exists for holidays in retail. Various models and technologies are suggested for more reliable retail forecasting (Raiyani, Lathigara, & Mehta, 2021). Some techniques from electricity load management research might be adapted to SCM due to similar challenges (Alicke, Glatzel, Hoberg, & Karlsson, 2017).

2.3 Research Questions
To explore operational challenges and opportunities, especially during holidays in the food retail sector, we propose the following research questions:
RQ1. How do professionals respond to automation in demand planning, particularly for holiday management?
RQ2. What criteria are essential for developing reliable demand forecasting models for holiday periods in the food retail sector?
RQ3. How can AI support organizations, especially during high-demand holiday periods?
RQ4. How can real-time data exchange improve communication among Supply Chain partners during holidays?

3.	Methodology
To address these research questions, a qualitative analysis approach was adopted. This method allows for an in-depth examination of a phenomenon within a specific context (Kalika, Mouricou, & Garreau, 2021). Given the limited available literature directly concerning demand planning during holiday periods in the food retail sector, a qualitative data collection design is particularly well-suited to this research.
3.1 Sample Presentation
The research field focuses specifically on supply chain partners within the food retail industry. Interview participants were selected for their involvement in the food sector, their connections with supply chain partners, and their roles in demand planning. In interviews, demand management concerning public holidays was examined in terms of ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) use, the reliability of automated calculations, and communication with commercial partners. Participants shared insights on professional practices and personal perspectives on these topics. Given the broad impact of public holidays, participants were chosen based on their operational and strategic roles within their companies, enabling them to provide a long-term perspective. Various departments within the same organization were involved in the information-gathering process, allowing for a cumulative approach to the research topic.
In this study, two key food retail supply chain stakeholders were interviewed. The first group includes representatives from a retail company, specifically the case of Lidl, with interviewees in warehouse roles such as Inbound and Outbound Flow Managers, along with a Senior Supply Planner for international logistics, based at headquarters. Concurrently, interviews were conducted with suppliers about their practices. The role of Demand Planners involves overseeing customer demand, while Key Account Managers focus on client communication.
3.2 Data Collection
The data collection process was carried out in two stages. Initial contact with professionals took place on LinkedIn, where potential participants showed interest in the research topic and were provided the interview questions in advance via email.
The survey was conducted from April 15 to May 8, 2024—a challenging period for the retail industry due to multiple public holidays that disrupt regular operations. Most respondents, being operational professionals, opted to participate in the study through semi-structured phone interviews or in written form to avoid interrupting their daily work. 
3.3 Data Analysis
For the qualitative data analysis, a coding method was employed. Specific "codes" were assigned to data segments to create an analytical framework. In this project, nine segments were identified: A. communication between partners,
B. quality control of forecasts,
C. demand planning methods used,
D. criteria considered in forecasts,
E. critical perspectives on ERP and AI,
F. forecasting objectives,
G. risks associated with public holidays for the roles of participants.
Results from the empirical data were organized using NVivo software, which allowed quotations from the interviews to be categorized in a table (Available on demand), facilitating comparisons among participants. This approach enabled a detailed analysis by breaking down and classifying interview responses, thereby providing a comprehensive view of the findings (Kalika, Mouricou, & Garreau, 2021).
Additionally, raw data extracts in the form of verbatim quotes were included to illustrate the results directly in the report.
A Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) was also conducted to add a preventive perspective on the criteria influencing demand planning. This reliability management technique helps identify potential failure modes in products, processes, and services to allocate necessary resources for improvement and risk mitigation. Traditional FMECA considers risk factors of Frequency (F), Severity (S), and Detection Delay (D), although other risk factors can be integrated (Liu, Chen, Duan, & Wang, 2019). In this study, a classic FMECA was performed to prioritize factors potentially impacting planning and thereby affecting operations.
The interviews helped to identify critical criteria for demand planning on public holidays, their recurrence, and their effects. FMECA is a widely recognized method for modeling and ranking risks.

5. Discussion
Our study builds upon findings by Obermair, Holzapfel, and Kuhn (2023). The issue of implementing AI in ERP systems to manage operations during public holidays, particularly for demand planning automation, highlights three main areas of focus:
•	The selection of criteria affecting demand and the choice of appropriate forecasting models, especially for holiday periods.
•	The necessity of promoting data transparency to enable real-time communication and enhanced flexibility in adjustments.
•	The importance of a strategy encompassing persuasion, support, and training to ensure the acceptance and effective use of these technologies by professionals.
5.1 Theoretical Contribution
This study contributes to theory by adding a cumulative perspective to the existing literature on public holidays in the food retail industry. It raises the possibility of adapting the integration of probabilistic and machine learning models, already effective in other sectors, to anticipate demand planning for public holidays in food retail.
In demand planning for electricity loads (Ziel, 2018), various scenarios are compared. For food retail, given the multiplicity of factors influencing demand planning, our analysis shows the need to incorporate a broad range of criteria to achieve accurate forecasts. Some models tested in Ziel's study could be modified and adapted into advanced neural network models, as suggested by the author, to account for a wide variety of factors.
Examining the criteria used by professionals in forecasting for public holidays will enhance forecast accuracy. With AI, these criteria can be aggregated for more precise analysis.
Mastering automation for operations management, especially around public holidays, could improve accuracy by increasing the number of criteria used in calculations. Demand planning for holidays in the food retail industry is a relatively unexplored topic in the academic literature (Obermair, Holzapfel, & Kuhn, 2023).
At this point, it is difficult to determine the effectiveness of AI for holiday-specific demand forecasting or to establish a consensus on general demand forecasting practices. This is why collaboration between practitioners and researchers on this topic is essential to avoid resistance to change and innovation. Although professionals hold mixed views on AI, our study suggests that AI, with its vast data processing capabilities, offers an innovative approach to improve forecast quality during fluctuations like public holidays.
5.2 Managerial Contribution
The managerial implications of this research suggest a broader emphasis on public holidays. Various supply chain stakeholders may be economically affected by these holidays, as they disrupt established operational routines. The human factor is also strongly impacted since additional workloads are required on these typically non-working days, affecting unskilled labor as well.
Beyond the economic implications, it is crucial to consider food waste in demand forecasting. Supply chain actors should incorporate this concept into their strategic planning to increase awareness of the impact of their actions on the environment and society.
Efforts must be initiated and communicated across all departments to promote team cohesion and mutual understanding of the constraints faced by various company entities. A principle of global communication would enable each participant to anticipate incoming requests from suppliers, carriers, and warehouses. Integrating AI could help develop these skills, speed up data transmission and visualization, and allow all operational stakeholders to react more promptly.
Training employees to understand automation mechanisms is a challenge that companies could take on to boost confidence in AI. Implementing AI methods within a company requires scalable infrastructure and skilled labor, both of which are essential investments to maintain competitiveness and growth in a constantly evolving digital world.
